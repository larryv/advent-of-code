# --- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---
#
# With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the
# airport. While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not
# safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees.
# You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.
#
# Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact
# integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of
# the open squares (".") and trees ("#") you can see. For example:
#
#     ..##.......
#     #...#...#..
#     .#....#..#.
#     ..#.#...#.#
#     .#...##..#.
#     ..#.##.....
#     .#.#.#....#
#     .#........#
#     #.##...#...
#     #...##....#
#     .#..#...#.#
#
# These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about
# once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern
# repeats to the right many times:
#
#     ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
#     #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
#     .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
#     ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
#     .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
#     ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
#     .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
#     .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
#     #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
#     #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
#     .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
#
# You start on the open square (".") in the top-left corner and need to
# reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).
#
# The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for
# a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all
# the trees you would encounter for the slope "right 3, down 1":
#
# From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that
# is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and
# down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.
#
# The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with
# "O" where there was an open square and "X" where there was a tree:
#
#     ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
#     #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
#     .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
#     ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
#     .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
#     ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
#     .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
#     .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
#     #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
#     #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
#     .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
#
# In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you
# to encounter 7 trees.
#
# Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of
# right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
#
#
# --- Part Two ---
#
# Time to check the rest of the slopes - you need to minimize the
# probability of a sudden arboreal stop, after all.
#
# Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the
# following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the
# map all the way to the bottom:
#
#   - Right 1, down 1.
#   - Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
#   - Right 5, down 1.
#   - Right 7, down 1.
#   - Right 1, down 2.
#
# In the above example, these slopes would find 2, 7, 3, 4, and
# 2 tree(s) respectively; multiplied together, these produce the answer
# 336.
#
# What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees
# encountered on each of the listed slopes?
