Advent of Code solutions
========================

[Advent of Code][AoC] is a series of Christmas-themed programming
puzzles by [Eric Wastl][EW].  These are my solutions to said puzzles.

A [makefile][] is provided for convenience.  For example, this command
runs the solution [`2020/day01.awk`][2020/01] (yes, omit the suffix):

```sh
make 2020/day01
```

I generally assume an environment that conforms to [POSIX.1-2017][POSIX]
but do make occasional portability accommodations at whim.

These solutions are published from the United States of America using
the [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication][CC0].
