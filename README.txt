Advent of Code solutions
========================

Advent of Code [1] is a series of Christmas-themed programming puzzles
by Eric Wastl [2].  These are my solutions to said puzzles.

A makefile is provided for convenience.  For example, this command runs
the solution 2020/day01.awk (yes, omit the suffix):

    make 2020/day01

I generally assume an environment that conforms to POSIX.1-2017 [3] but
do make occasional portability accommodations at whim.

These solutions are published from the United States of America using
